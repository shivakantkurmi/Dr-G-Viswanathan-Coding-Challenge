# 🚀 #DrGViswanathan Coding Challenge

## ✨ Overview

The **#DrGViswanathan Coding Challenge** is a personal journey of discipline, learning, and gratitude — started as a tribute to **Dr. G. Viswanathan**, the esteemed founder of VIT.

Originally, this challenge was set for **51 days** of continuous coding, project work, and knowledge sharing. After completing that phase successfully, I chose to **extend it by another 50 days**, bringing deeper meaning to the journey by aligning it with **Mother’s Day and Father’s Day** — dedicating the continuation of this challenge to the two most important pillars of my life: **my parents**.

This is more than just a coding streak — it is a celebration of mentorship, family, and persistence.
